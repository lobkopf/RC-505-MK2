# RC-505 MK2 Documentation and Resources Projects
This Project aims to collect resources and information about the Boss RC-505 MK2. The official manuals and documentation by Boss are a good starting point for anyone new with the machine. But often when trying to search or do something specific the official documents fall short of being helpful due to abstract explanations or lack of concrete values/data.

This Project is meant as a helpful repository of as many data, information, tips, tricks and techniques as possible. Nevertheless it is a work in progress and anyone who is willing to contribute or has any suggestions is more then welcome to do so.
